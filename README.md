# clock
"L’horloge de mamie" project
⏰This project is a console-based clock application that allows users to set the current time, choose a time format (12-hour or 24-hour), and set an alarm. The clock runs in real-time, updating every second, and can be paused or resumed. The user can interact with the clock through a menu-driven interface, which includes options to set the time, choose the format, and manage the alarm. The program also uses threading to run the clock in the background while checking for keypresses to control the clock’s state.
